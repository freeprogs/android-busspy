10. TROUBLESHOOTING

If you can not build the application in your Android Studio, then you
should configure it according to the requirements section. On newer
versions of different components in Android Studio the application may
not be built correctly and Android Studio may write red errors,
pointing to the reasons. So you should set older versions of
components and dependencies in files like `__DNAME_APP_BUILD_GRADLE__/__FNAME_APP_BUILD_GRADLE__' and
similar.
